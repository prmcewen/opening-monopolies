5. A Crash Course in Libertarian Anti-IP Theory

As I outlined in the Preface, there are two starkly differing frameworks that can lead one to call for the abolition of patents and copyrights. The utilitarian argument that we would all be better off without intellectual property for reasons such as more innovation, greater economic growth and quality of life, more creative works being produce and higher quality and greater variety of creative works being produced an the natural rights or ethical argument that intellectual property is not property at all and thus does not merit grants of monopoly.

The Utilitarian Case

The utilitarian case is inherently an empirical one. It requires a comprehensive look at creation and innovation across a huge number of different industries and the economics that impact those industries. Such a task is far beyond the scope of this book and has already been completed at a level well beyond the capabilities of this author by Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine in their book Against Intellectual Monopoly.

Rather than trying to replicate their work in this book, I will instead take on the much simpler task of persuading those that might disagree that if you have reached the conclusion that patents and copyright are necessary to spur innovation and have not undertaken either the performing of or reading of a comprehensive empirical analysis, you ought to do so before reaching such a conclusion.[48]

For starters, any claim that inventions or creative works would not be produced without grants of monopoly from government are clearly false. Writers were not able to utilize copyright to profit from their works because no form of copyright existed in any country until the London Company of Stationers was given monopoly power to regulate the writing and publishing industry in England in 1557,[49] yet there are books that date back to before that time.[50] Inventors like Gutenberg were not able to patent their inventions at all. It was not until the early 1980's that computer software become eligible for either copyright or patent protection.[51]

Even in the times of complete copyright and patent protection that we currently live in there are examples of inventions and creative works that flourish without intellectual property protection. Artist Nina Paley released her movie Sita Sings the Blues very successfully under a Creative Commons Share Alike License.[52]

The Linux operating system is released under the GNU General Public License which passes up most copyright and patent restrictions and is so successful that it is the dominant operating system of virtually every computer category other than desktop computers. It powers the majority of servers, supercomputers and a growing number of smart phones. The entire fashion industry also operates without any form of intellectual property protection for new design.[53]

There is also no doubt that there are costs to intellectual property.[54] From attorney's, to enforcement costs, to patent trolls, the costs of the patent system in particular are directly connected to the intellectual property system and compared to the alleged benefits, easily observed and quantified. Thus particularly for those who claim that intellectual property is a net benefit from a utilitarian perspective, such a statement must be an empirical question. Costs and benefits require such an analysis to demonstrate which one is greater.

It is also worth noting that while many of the proponents of the utilitarian case against intellectual property are libertarians or libertarian-leaning, there is nothing inherently libertarian about it. By definition, a utilitarian framework does not require inherently libertarian values, though there are certainly exclusively utilitarian libertarians.[55]

The Natural Rights Case

The most comprehensive libertarian case against intellectual property ever written is very likely Stephan Kinsella's Against Intellectual Property. His argument goes back to the foundations of libertarian theory to the reason for the existence of private property rights in the first place. The reason for needing a system of property rights comes from that fact that physical property is scarce and excludable. If land or goods were unlimited and could be used without influencing anyone else's use of the same land or goods, there would be no reason for property rights. Everyone would simply use as much as they wanted in whatever manner they wished without any conflict.

The ideas that are subject to intellectual property restrictions through patents and copyrights are different. Ideas on the other hand are not scarce. While they are not scarce in the sense that everyone has an unlimited supply of worthwhile ideas, they are not scarce in the sense that everyone can use the same idea without stopping the original owner from using it as well. As artist Nina Paley so eloquently rhymes in her video “Copying is Not Theft”, “Copying is not theft. Stealing a thing leaves one less left. Copying it makes one thing more; that’s what copying’s for.”[56]

There is also an argument often repeated by libertarians in the form of a reductio ad absurdum[57] aimed at showing that the idea of intellectual property is inherently incompatible with our notions of physical property. The exact line of argumentation depends on the particular version of intellectual property being argued against, but the idea is basically the same. Any enforcement of intellectual property rights requires restricting the ability of non-consenting individuals to do as they wish with their own property. If you have a patent on a new kind of mousetrap, I am prohibited from taking materials that I own and combining them into certain shapes. Unless I have signed some kind of contract with you as the inventor, this clearly violates my property rights. Similar arguments can be made for my ability to print certain texts with my printer, ink and paper or to perform songs with my own instruments on my own property.

Defenses of intellectual property, such as the one put forth by Ayn Rand,[58]
that do not allow for an independent inventor defense and grant exclusive monopoly privileges to the first to either create a particular invention or to file for a patent on the invention with the patent office. Some libertarians have advanced theories that permit an independent inventor defense. For example novelist J. Neil Schulman's theory of logorights argues that any creation that is not unique enough to allow for independent invention does not merit an exclusive monopoly in the first place.[59]

Libertarian philosopher Roderick T. Long, takes the argument one step further in his argument against intellectual property. He argues that intellectual property necessitates owning other people because of our ability to store copies of ideas in our minds:

>It may be objected that the person who originated the information deserves ownership rights over it. But information is not a concrete thing an individual can control; it is a universal, existing in other people's minds and other people's property, and over these the originator has no legitimate sovereignty. You cannot own information without owning other people.

[48] Of course, if you really had taken F.A. Hayek's lesson to heart when he wrote in The Fatal Conceit that “the curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design,” perhaps this would be unneccessary.
[49] Lyman Ray Patterson, "Copyright And `The Exclusive Right' Of Authors", Journal of Intellectual Property, Vol. 1, No.1, Fall 1993, online at http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1342&context=fac_artchop. Patterson explains:
The event in the history of Anglo-American copyright that led to the shaping events of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was the Charter of the Stationers' Company granted in 1556 by Philip and Mary .... The Charter gave the stationers the power to make "ordinances, provisions, and statutes" for the governance of "the art or mistery of [s]tationery," as well as the power to search out illegal presses and books and things with the power of "seizing, taking, or burning the foresaid books or things, or any of them printed or to be printed contrary to the form of any statute, act, or proclamation ...."
The power to burn offending books was a benefit to the sovereign (a weapon against unlawful publications), and a boon to the stationers (a weapon against competition). The book-burning power thus shows the real motivation for the Charter, to secure the allegiance of the stationers as policemen of the press for the sovereign in an uncertain world.
