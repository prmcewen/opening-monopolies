15. Permissive Software as an Open Monopoly Trojan Horse

Imagine for a moment, the following situation. A software developer is undertaking a new project and has a policy, at least for this project, that all of their code must be closed source and proprietary. In the field of competitive software, there exists an open source program. For our concerns, the competitive proprietary products are irrelevant. Lets consider how the situation might play out different if the open source program is copyleft licenses, for example under the GPL, compared to how it would play out if the open source program is permissively licensed, for example under the BSD license.

Under the copyleft scenario, the developer is forced to weight their desire to keep all of their original code and modifications closed source and proprietary against the advantages of starting to build their program from an already existing one. However, there is a good chance that such a decision really isn’t a decision at all. If the developer makes their money based upon a business model that is dependent upon selling closed source, proprietary software, choosing to develop a copyleft program would force them to fundamentally change their business model, which because it wasn’t the decision in question, leaves them with no real decision at all. There are certainly examples of companies who do decide to change their business model to an open source one to develop copyleft software, but even in some of those cases building from existing copyleft programs isn’t an option because they require full ownership of the copyright to the software in order to sell proprietary licenses to the copyleft software the create.

Even in cases where developers do choose to use copyleft software as a starting point, that doesn’t necessarily guarantee that all of their additional code will be made open source. That’s exactly what happened when Apple built their Safari web browser on the WebKit rendering engine and happens when any LGPL licensed library is used in proprietary softare. Of course improvements and modifications to the copyleft code itself are required to have their source code shared.

Going back to the permissive license scenario discussed previously, the options that were available to the developer under the copyleft scenario are still available. They still could choose to not use the open source code as a starting point or they could choose to make all or part of their code open source. The difference of course being that making the code open source would be a purely voluntary choice on their part rather than a legal requirement. The permissive license also gives them an additional option, to keep modifications to the open source code closed and only release them as proprietary binaries.

The scenario will also operate on the assumption that there is at least some probably of the developer choosing to keep modifications to the open source code closed and that the availability of permissively licensed means that the odds of the developer choosing either to not use the open source software at all and the odds that some of the code will be made open are not only lower in the aggregate, but the probability of each decision individually is also lower.

Free software advocates have conventionally thought of the prospects of a developer taking open source code closed as at best no better than the developer having used entirely proprietary software that they either bought or wrote themselves and at worst a harm to free software as a whole because it subsidized the development of non-free software and allowed proprietary developers to create a better product with less time, effort and expense. Such an attitude views the race between free software and non-free software as one where copyleft code is an advantage for free software, any closed source code that only proprietary developers have access to is an advantage for close source software and permissively licensed code is neutral because it can be used equally by both.

The Free Software Foundation provides the perfect example of this attitude when in an essay trying to convince programmers to use strong copyleft GPL for their next library rather than the weak copyleft LGPL when they wrote:

>Using the ordinary GPL is not advantageous for every library. There are reasons that can make it better to use the Lesser GPL in certain cases. The most common case is when a free library's features are readily available for proprietary software through other alternative libraries. In that case, the library cannot give free software any particular advantage, so it is better to use the Lesser GPL for that library.

>This is why we used the Lesser GPL for the GNU C library. After all, there are plenty of other C libraries; using the GPL for ours would have driven proprietary software developers to use another—no problem for them, only for us.

However, when a library provides a significant unique capability, like GNU Readline, that's a horse of a different color. The Readline library implements input editing and history for interactive programs, and that's a facility not generally available elsewhere. Releasing it under the GPL and limiting its use to free programs gives our community a real boost. At least one application program is free software today specifically because that was necessary for using Readline.[106]

However, such a view is an approach that is limited by both a short time horizon and an overly simplistic horse race metric of evaluation. 
The open source code serves as a Trojan Horse of sorts in the battle between closed and open source software. Inside are not enough soldiers to win the battle by themselves, but there are certainly enough to open the gates and allow the battle to take place without giving proprietary software any walls to hide behind. For those that believe the open source development process is superior to a closed one, it is the walls that are to be feared, not the battle itself.

In the scenario of a developer potentially building on permissively licensed software that the discussion has become momentarily distracted from, there are several important decisions that have already been made for the developer by virtue of choosing to build upon an existing piece of software. The programming language, libraries and other dependencies, and development tools will have already been chosen by the creator of the open source base. While code can be rewritten to add new closed dependencies of various kinds, but since doing so takes more work, the odds are certainly lower than if the code had been closed from the start. For example, software that uses the multi-platform OpenGL to produce graphics could be rewritten to use Microsoft’s Windows only DirectX, but software is certainly more likely to end up using OpenGL if it is based upon code that is already using OpenGL.

In cases where there exist multiple competing formats or standards, software built on an open source program will already have full support for the open format or standard. For example, a productivity suite based upon Apache Open Office will already have full support for OpenDocument Formats. In contrast, Microsoft’s implementations of the formats in the 2007 version of Office had many problems and did not include full support of multiple features.[107] In theory, a developer could strip out support for open formats. However, we can only imagine the PR nightmare that would befall a company who made such a decision.[108]

Even when there are closed source changes that are made to previously open software, if it results in the final product being closed to open source software, the result can potentially have enormous implications for the open source community. For example, had Apple chosen to base OS X on Linux rather than NeXTSTEP,[109] even if all the changes were kept closed,[110] increased similarity could make it substantially easier for developers looking to port their OS X software over to Linux. For example, every additional similarity between the two operating systems could only help make it easier for Valve to create a Linux version of Steam.[111]
