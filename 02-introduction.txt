2. Introduction

One of the most critical moments in the history of Internet innovation was the first half of the last decade when Microsoft seemed poised to vanquish Netscape’s browser offerings to the dustbin of computer programs and assume complete dominance over the Internet user experience through the over 90% market share of their Internet Explorer web browser. 

It's not as though no one saw it coming. In fact it was widely anticipated. On May 18, 1998, a time when most estimates has Netscape's Navigator browser with over double the market share of Internet Explorer,[0] the United States Justice Department under the direction of Attorney General Janet Reno in conjunction with the Attorney Generals of 20 states and the District of Columbia filed suit against Microsoft, charging them “with engaging in anticompetitive and exclusionary practices designed to maintain its monopoly in personal computer operating systems and to extend that monopoly to Internet browsing software.”[1]
 
Libertarians at the time were justifiably outraged at the use of antitrust law to interfere in the market. Many free market advocates rushed to Microsoft’s side because they represented the private sector under outright and open attack by the government. Over the next several years a plethora of literature condemning antitrust laws was published by libertarians with a wide range of affiliations.[2]

Most of them stuck to condemning the antitrust suit and the political rent seeking of Microsoft’s competitors.[3] However, the key argument in nearly all of them to emphasize the absurdity of the claims that the only barrier to entry for browsers trying to compete with Internet Explorer was 2 or 3 clicks of the mouse to install them. While that was certainly true at the time, it was not representative of the future threat. Many programmers understood the threat. With the exception of those who qualify as such programmers, few libertarians did.

A couple of libertarians writing against the antitrust suits went even further than just condemning the governments action, they asserted or implied that consumers would be made better off if Microsoft were left to rule the Internet experience.

Cato Institute senior fellow Robert A. Levy asserted in a policy paper early in 1998 that:

>Never mind that Windows became the industry standard because PC makers thought it was a "superior" product -- an assessment that surely took into account the entire array of product features, not only technical features but also ease of use, quality, price, service, and contract terms. Never mind that consumers shared that view. Never mind that there were no barriers to entry that would prevent a competitor from ousting Windows as the market leader. Those considerations, apparently, did not impress DOJ's Antitrust Division.[4]

Mises Institute adjunct scholar Christopher Westley wrote about the preference of economists for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser over rival Netscape’s Navigator browser because of Netscape’s political rent seeking.[5]

Lew Rockwell praised Microsoft as “one of the great success stories in the history of American enterprise.”[6]

None of them understood the threat the Microsoft posed to market based Internet innovation. The basic idea of the Microsoft menace is perhaps best explained through the lens of a topic of discussion libertarians are more familiar with, monetary policy and central banking. Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild international Banking Dynasty, infamously said in 1790, “Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation and I care not who makes the laws.” The Internet equivalent of this quote would be something along the lines of “Permit me to control the specification of Internet standards and I care not who is permitted to write the software.”

It doesn’t matter who can write the software because the standard is source from which all of the power is derived. Though just like it is the laws that decide who is permitted to control the money, it is the developers of Internet software that control who writes the standards because the standards are meaningless unless the software conforms to them. In short, the end goal of Microsoft was not dominance of the web browser market. That was merely a means to their true ends, a world where competing with Microsoft software would mean the creation of an entirely separate computer ecosystem. Short of a government edict completely barring competition, it perhaps could have been the largest barriers to entry into the software market that could ever be constructed. 

Microsoft had created an ecosystem that had thrived because of the openness and competition that was on both sides of their operating system. Anyone who wanted to could create and sell either computer hardware which ran Windows or applications which ran on Windows. Competition was driving prices down and quality up. 

While consumers preferred Windows for the time being, Microsoft wanted to ensure that even if a superior operating system emerged, consumers would be stuck having to use it anyways. They feared that if consumers had the choice of using their applications, like productivity suites and web browsers, on any operating system, consumers could too easily switch over to another operating system that was better or cheaper.

Microsoft could have chosen to combat this threat by ensuring that their operating system would always be the preferred choice of consumers. Instead, as internal Microsoft documents spell out quite clearly, they planned to pursue a strategy of . Exhibit A of their plans was featured in the press release from the Justice Department that announced the filing of the lawsuit:

>This threat was described by Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in a 1995 warning to Microsoft executives:
>>"A new competitor "born" on the Internet is Netscape. Their browser is dominant, with a 70% usage share, allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch on. They are pursuing a multi-platform strategy where they move the key API [applications programming interface] into the client to commoditize the underlying operating system."[7]

Though the word commoditize is probably more commonly used by the far left to deride the use of free market pricing to allocate resources in areas they don’t approve such as education or health care, but that is not the meaning in the context in which Gates uses it in the memo. What he means is that the approach of Netscape would make the market for the underlying operating system on which the browser ran more like a commodities market. Just like commodity markets treat raw materials like a bushel of corn or a barrel of oil as essentially the same, the separation of features between the operating system and the browser means that any operating system can access all of the features of the Internet and becomes less unique to the user. If a Netscape browser can provide the same Internet experience on any operating system, it becomes much easier for new or currently less successful operating systems to steal market share from Windows.

To frame the discussion in the context of economic models, commodization of various software markets would push it closer towards perfect competition and away from a monopolistic one. Though a software market can never end up as a perfectly competitive market in the same sense that the markets for corn or oil are nor is it likely that a consumer would ever truly be stuck with only a single choice of operating system or word processor, the distinction is meaningful. On one end of the spectrum is a world where features can be implemented by any software developer and the consumer is left to pick and choose which software they prefer. At the other end is a software market where some hurdle prevents certain features from appearing in the software of all but one developer. This hurdle could be political in nature, such as a regulation; have its basis in intellectual property, such as a patent; or technological in nature, such as an undocumented API or protocol that only one firm is able to access.

For someone unfamiliar with many of the features and technologies that go into making a browser, it might be hard to grasp why the dominance of one browser that was only available for a single operating system was such a big deal back then. After all in today’s browser market, Internet Explorer is only available on Windows and Safari only on Macs. The Internet experience is nearly identical whether one uses either of those browsers or Chrome or Firefox which are available across multiple operating systems.

The answer is simply that those people who wanted to commodify operating systems and Internet browsers won and Microsoft lost. Before you start thinking this is some perverse attempt to justify the antitrust lawsuit, let me assure you that it’s not.
 
It turns out that the antitrust lawsuit did nothing to stop Internet Explorer from coming to utterly dominate the browser market. Though market share of browsers is difficult to calculate and the survey methodology used in the late 90’s made it even worse, estimates of IE’s use in 1997, before the lawsuit was filed, placed it at somewhere between about 20% and 30% with Netscape Navigator representing all but about 5% of the remaining market share.[8] By 2004, well after the antitrust lawsuit had concluded, all estimates of IE use had the browser capturing over 90% of the market, one estimate had it as high as 96%.[9]

Before we can discuss why the disastrous things predicted by the opponents of Microsoft’s market dominance failed to come to fruition, it’s important to discuss what exactly those things were.

The previously quoted internal memo from Bill Gates is not the only look at internal Microsoft strategy. During the last week of October, 1998 an internal Microsoft memorandum was leaked to Eric Raymond who annotated it over Halloween weekend and released it on November 1st calling it the “Halloween Document.”[10] It contained more details about Microsoft's plans to “de-commoditize” key protocols to fend off competition from open source software (OSS):

>De-commoditize protocols & applications

>OSS projects have been able to gain a foothold in many server applications because of the wide utility of highly commoditized, simple protocols. By extending these protocols and developing new protocols, we can deny OSS projects entry into the market.

>David Stutz makes a very good point: in competing with Microsoft's level of desktop integration, "commodity protocols actually become the means of integration" for OSS projects. There is a large amount of IQ being expended in various IETF working groups which are quickly creating the architectural model for integration for these OSS projects.[11]

The IETF that is referenced is the Internet Engineering Task Force, a group dedicated to the developing and promoting Internet standards. For example, if you have ever tried to visit a page on a website that does not exist, no matter what operating system and browser you use or what operating system is used by the server hosting the website, you will receive an error message that reads something like “404 Error: Page Not Found.” Why is it always a 404 error? Because that’s what the IETF decided the error number should be.[12]

As Raymond explains in his annotations, “In other words, open protocols must be locked up and the IETF crushed in order to de-commoditize protocols & applications and stop open-source software.”[13] The idea is to get people, in this case especially corporate customers, to start using closed, undocumented or insufficiently detailed standards that only Microsoft can access or easily use and create a potentially insurmountable technical standard for competitors.

Microsoft’s strategy was to lock in their customers, so that they would have no choice but to keep buying their products and exploit network effects to use their market dominance to lure in even more people. From a libertarian perspective, technological barriers to competition and market entry provide no issue because they are not based on an advantage conferred on them by government.

However, for those who support free markets because of the innovation and prosperity they create as the result of choice and competition, it is not clear that artificial technical barriers are any more acceptable than unlibertarian political barriers. Whether I am unable to choose to use software I prefer because its use or development is forbidden by the government or a comparable situation is created by a technical barrier implemented by a developer, not to provide new desirable features, but purely to lock-in users or prevent the development of software that can provide the same features on the same platform, the outcome is essentially unchanged.

If the idea that Microsoft lost the war for control over Internet standards despite winning the battle for control of the browser market, doesn’t quite make sense, that’s because the true goal hasn’t yet been mentioned, the server market. Since browsers have long been given away for free rather than sold, victory in the browser battle meant little for Microsoft’s bottom line. Browsers were just the means to the high ground in the much more lucrative battle taking place in the server market.

As Eric Raymond explained:

>For Netscape, the issue was less browser-related income (never more than a small fraction of their revenues) than maintaining a safe space for their much more valuable server business. If Microsoft's Internet Explorer achieved market dominance, Microsoft would be able to bend the Web's protocols away from open standards and into proprietary channels that only Microsoft's servers would be able to service.

Despite Microsoft’s utter dominance in capturing a greater than 90% share of both the operating system[14] and browser markets in the years following the antitrust lawsuit, they never managed to come anywhere close in the server market. Measuring the number of servers running various operating systems is a difficult task because not every server continues to run the same operating system that it was sold with. However, more important, and more easily measurable, than the operating system was the software that powered the websites hosted on the server. That data is easier to gather and from it we know that the the open source Apache web server has been since dominant 1996. Measured by number of domain names running the software, Microsoft’s server offerings have never managed to top 40% of the market and Apache has maintained more than 50% of the market for more than a decade.[15]

Who was behind Apache that allowed it to take on Microsoft and win? Essentially just 8 server administrators and their email list exchanging patches to the NCSA HTTPd server software that they were running.[16] Of course over time, it would grow to involve many more people, but the core development model never changed much.

As long as Apache controlled a majority of the server market, Microsoft would need them to go along with any changes to standard Internet protocols. As long as Apache remained open source and largely running on Linux powered servers, Microsoft’s “embrance and extend” strategy couldn’t use Apache to bend protocols into closed, proprietary channels.

A libertarian might read this story and proclaim that it is yet another example of the triumph of the free market, though it runs somewhat contrary to the narrative that the freedom Microsoft won to continue its monopolies in the face of the antitrust suit was a victory for the market. In a general sense that claim is essentially correct. However, such a description conceals just who the free market. in this case, essentially a bunch of computer programmers acting deliberately together to keep the Internet open and give people a choice of software to use it with.

As Virgina Postrel somewhat predictively wrote in Reason in 1999:

>At stake is what Eric S. Raymond, editor of "The New Hacker's Dictionary" and a Linux evangelist, calls a quasi-political question: "Will the Internet culture tolerate single-vendor monopolies on critical infrastructure or not?" The answer appears to be no. Internet culture will work to undermine monopolies. And it will do so faster, and more harmoniously with the fluid nature of the technical world, than will lawyers.[17]

Perhaps, the culture 

In the same way that libertarians use tools of economic analysis to conclude that government regulations harm consumers and stifle entrepreneurial innovation, it can be shown that when software developers add features to their software that are designed to lock-in consumers and prevent the emergence of competitive choices in the market have many of the same detrimental impacts on consumers and free market competition. Of course, government actions to interfere in the free market certainly present addition moral concerns for libertarians that are not present in the purely private creation of artificial barriers to competition, like the ones Microsoft often seeks to impose on consumers.

Libertarian economists have long argued that gold and the gold standard are free enterprise money,[19] software licenses that place no restrictions on the licensee, software that makes the source code available to all and open standards that make their documentation available for anyone to see, use and implement constitute free enterprise software. Though it is wrong to have the government restrict people from using any software they choose and we don’t yet have as large of an empirical data set to pull from as we do with the gold standard, it is clear that such software wins out in free market competition.[20]

Such software also ought to be much less controversial than the gold standard even within the libertarian community. While even some libertarians manage to come up with reasons why a free market in money is unworkable,[21] there ought to be no debate that anyone who does not support a free market in computer software is no libertarian at all.

The Intellectual Property Version

It should not be too surprising that there is a much more simple way to demonstrate from a libertarian perspective that Microsoft’s actions were not the free market ____ that some had made them out to be. The basis of the bargaining power that allowed Microsoft to dictate the licensing terms that they used to restrict competition was not derived from the free market, but rather from government granted monopolies on their intellectual property in the forms of patents and copyright.

In the late 90’s as the antitrust lawsuit was still in full swing, some libertarians still held flawed beliefs about the economics surrounding intellectual property. For example, in a 1998 article on Microsoft for the Mises Institute’s Free Market, Françoise Melese wrote that a popular operating system was an example of a scarce resource that could lead to the creation of a natural monopoly.[22]

Over 12 years after the antitrust lawsuit was filed against Microsoft, Stephan Kinsella said in an interview with Jeffrey Tucker, about the issue of intellectual property that:[23]

>Finally, everything fell into place, primarily from Rothbard and Misesian theory. I found that this issue is difficult, but once you see it, it's one of these issues that sets peoples' minds on fire. It frees you to think about other things in different ways. It's like five or six other walls also fall in your mind on topics that you already had a view on. Now you can see them in a different light — about economic theory and libertarian theory.
For me one of those other topics was software licensing. 

As libertarian computer programmer Eric Raymond explained in November of 1998:

Libertarians must be willing to forthrightly condemn such behavior. Otherwise we will justly be accused of desiring a future in which such tactics are the norm. If we are not willing to be part of the market `invisible hand' that non-coercively punishes Microsoft for its misbehavior, we invite the argument that only coercion will do.

The only principled response to the facts is to condemn both the DOJ and Microsoft. That one party is a villain does not make the other a saint, and even the fact that one side is clearly using coercion does not automatically redeem the other from the charge of having behaved badly.[18]
