3. Joining the Invisible Hand

A libertarian might read the story told in the last chapter and proclaim that Microsoft's failure to lock consumers into using their Internet Explorer browser is yet another example of the triumph of the free market, even though such a declaration runs somewhat contrary to the narrative that the freedom Microsoft won to continue its monopolies in the face of the antitrust suit was a victory for the market. In a general sense that claim is essentially correct. However, such a description conceals just who makes up the free market. In this case, essentially a bunch of computer programmers acting deliberately together to keep the Internet open and give people a choice of software to use it with.

As Virgina Postrel somewhat predictively wrote in Reason in 1999:

>At stake is what Eric S. Raymond, editor of "The New Hacker's Dictionary" and a Linux evangelist, calls a quasi-political question: "Will the Internet culture tolerate single-vendor monopolies on critical infrastructure or not?" The answer appears to be no. Internet culture will work to undermine monopolies. And it will do so faster, and more harmoniously with the fluid nature of the technical world, than will lawyers.[17]

It is really only with the perspective of over a decade of hindsight that from Postrel's prediction about the answer to that question that we can truly say she might have been correct in saying it was no. In 2004, with Microsoft in control of well over 90% of the browsers in use, the answer appeared to be yes. The time frame of the question determines the answer because as the Internet Explorer example proves, on occassion the Internet culture will tolerate single-vendor monopolies on critical infrastructure. However, both the browser market and evidence from other areas of the Internet demonstrates that while single pieces of software, such as Apache, can dominate Internet infrastructure for well over a decade with little sign of going anywhere anytime soon, single vendor monopolies tend to have a much shorter lifespan.

Some might argue that the culture of the Internet and the people, most importantly the server administrators, web designers and programmers, who make up that culture were secondary to the underlying economics in keeping the Internet open. That whether anyone was paying attention and fighting for certain standards and software out of principle, the superior innovation anbd efficiency of an open Internet and browser standards would have emerged victorious eventually. 

Several libertarian writers who have written about technology and received emails from readers encouraging them to try out and adopt the Linux operating system have taken a somewhat similar attitude. They respond to claims that Linux is a superior operating system by arguing that if that was true,  . This puts any operating system that 

But, why do superior technologies emerge victorious from free market competition? It takes someone recognizing their superiority and choosing that product over the other available options. A complete discussion of why certain products succeed and others fail is beyond the scope of this book, but it is safe to say that superior quality alone is not always enough to succeed. It is human action that is the basis of the market economy.

Thus, it is wrong to separate the culture of the Internet from the free market. Rather than being distinct entities, the culture of the Internet and the people who comprise it are a part of the market. Claiming that open standards are inherently economically superior and that they are preferred by the Internet culture are essentially the same argument. They are economically superior precisely because they best fulfill the desires of Internet users and innovators. 

It is possible for some of the people that make up Internet culture to erroneously believe, for example, that a single vendor monopoly over critical infrastructure would be the best way of satisfying their demands and have free market competition prove that the underlying economics support something different. However, this demonstrates merely that those people were wrong about the best means to the ends valued by Internet culture, not that the economically superior technology is different from the demands of Internet users. It doesn't prove Internet culture wrong, just those individual's assessement of Internet culture.

In many ways the arguments that I just made about the Internet and computer software, mirror arguments libertarian economists have made about gold and the gold standard. Libertarian economists have long argued that gold is free enterprise money.[19] Their arguments are not based on what money is currently used, which would lead to the conclusion that fiat money has bested gold, but rather upon empirical evidence from history and the results of economic analysis. Were gold placed upon equal footing in market competition with other currencies, it's fairly certain that these economists would agree that informed consumers of money would choose to use gold over alternatives whether or not gold happened to be the most popular currency at the time. Furthermore, they argue that it is inevitable that gold backed currencies will win out in free market competition. There may be 

Software licenses that place no restrictions on the licensee, software that makes the source code available to all and open standards that make their complete and detailed documentation available for anyone to see, use and implement constitute free enterprise software. Though it is wrong to have the government restrict people from using any software they choose and we don’t yet have as large of an empirical data set to pull from as we do with the gold standard, it is clear that such software wins out in free market competition.[20]

Such software also ought to be much less controversial than the gold standard within the libertarian community. While even some libertarians manage to come up with reasons why a free market in money is unworkable, there ought to be no debate that anyone who does not support a free market in computer software is no libertarian at all.[21]

In the same way that libertarians use tools of economic analysis to conclude that government regulations harm consumers and stiinnfle entrepreneurial innovation, it can be shown that when software developers add features to their software that are designed to lock-in consumers and prevent the emergence of competitive choices in the market have many of the same detrimental impacts on consumers and free market competition. Of course, government actions to interfere in the free market certainly present addition moral concerns for libertarians that are not present in the purely private creation of artificial barriers to competition, like the ones Microsoft often seeks to impose on consumers.

As libertarian computer programmer Eric Raymond explained in November of 1998:

>Libertarians must be willing to forthrightly condemn such behavior. Otherwise we will justly be accused of desiring a future in which such tactics are the norm. If we are not willing to be part of the market `invisible hand' that non-coercively punishes Microsoft for its misbehavior, we invite the argument that only coercion will do.

>The only principled response to the facts is to condemn both the DOJ and Microsoft. That one party is a villain does not make the other a saint, and even the fact that one side is clearly using coercion does not automatically redeem the other from the charge of having behaved badly.[18]
