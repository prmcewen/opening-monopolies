13. Agency Harm and the Power of Your Choice

There is a reason that Google spends millions of dollars each year trying to get you to use their free browser or pick a phone powered by their free operating system, that Microsoft gives discounts to students and schools to get kids learning on computers powered by their software, that Apple tightly restricts the software ecosystems of their products, Richard Stallman and the FSF don't want you touching anything powered by non-free software and Facebook so desperately wants you to sign up for and log onto their free website. Users give them power. The power to control the direction of technology, software and the internet.

Microsoft and Apple want to use this power to lock you into their software ecosystems to make it easier for them to sell you more software. Google cares less about what ecosystem you use as long as while you are there you spend maximal amounts of time on the internet performing Google searches. Facebook and Google want information about you so that they can monetize your page views via advertising. Richard Stallman wants you using free software for ideological reasons and so that like a virus bringing about a zombie apocalypse, the GNU General Public License can infect everything.
The entire purpose of this book is to empower you with the knowledge that will turn you from one of their puppets into a full fledged player of your own. Odds are that you will never become a player on the scale that they are, but knowledge can make you a player none the less.

In a certain sense, software is like any other market in that consumers and businesses have needs that they need software to fill. However, software is a quintessential example of a two-sided market. Your decisions as a consumer help shape the supply and demand curves of software developers. You may have no choice about needing a word processor, a PDF reader or a web browser, but that doesn't mean you don't have any choice in the matter. What operating system does your word processor, PDF reader or web browser need to run on? What format should your word processor save in? What video and audio codecs should your browser have HTML5 support for? All of these are specifications that you as a consumer do have control over and collectively software developers can be forced to meet.

Some software markets even consist of multiple interfacing two sided markets. Take for example web browsers, there is the two sided market of the browser developers and browser users, but there is also the two sided market of browser users and the developers of the websites that people visit with those browsers. In order to implement a new standard, technology or feature on the web, all 3 groups have to choose to implement it.

As a software consumer, you also have the ability to grant power to the people who created the software you use because of the assumption that you will keep using their software. While there are certainly brand loyalty effects in other industries, software updates and other interactions with active users give developers a more unique source of power.

The criteria for evaluating direct agency harm are fairly straight forward as developed by Raymond and discussed previously. However, consisten with the underlying motivations of this book, there are two basic areas that will be looked at in consideration of indirect agency harm, how the company leverages intellectual property to limit competition and other tactics taken by the company to limit consumer choice without adding features, such as lock-in through closed formats. Intellectual property considerations also divide into concerns over software patents and the licenses that deal with software copyrights.

Past and existing patent lawsuits provide particularly good objective evidence that a company seeks to use the power of government granted intellectual property to gain an advantage over competitors in the market. Joining and contributing patents to pools designed to more easily extract patent rents is another piece of evidence that a company wishes to use their IP to restrict competition.

On the other hand choosing to contribute patents to defensive patent pools that allow others to defend themselves against patent lawsuits is evidence that a company doesn't want to use patents to restrict their competition. Choosing to irrevocably license patents to anyone who might want to use them or releasing software under license that fail to take advantage of the ability of copyright to restrict use are other signs of a pro-competition attitude towards intellectual property. Taking other steps to restrict their ability to file patent lawsuits, such as Twitter's Innovator's Patent Agreement which requires the permission of the engineer credited with an innovation before a lawsuit can be filed by the company it is assigned to,[86] also are positive signs about a firms approach to IP.

A measure of how the developer uses copyright is the licenses that are used for the other software they write. Whether directly through the purchase of the software or indirectly by enabling the developer to make money in other ways or just adding to their reputation, the use of software contributes to the ability of the developer to fund the creation of more software. Theoretically, users could just choose to use only the software from a certain developer that was released under less restrictive licenses, but in practice such a requirement would make using any computer for anything impossible.[87]

A third criteria for intellectual property concerns is the extent to which a company seeks to use their market power to steer consumers towards the use of formats and standards that they control due to their intellectual property. For example, a developer could choose to support a proprietary codec that requires licensing patents they own to use and to not support a competing open codec.

Evaluating non-intellecutal property related practices designed to errect artiicial walls to competition is more difficult than merely looking at how a company 

It is both an enormous task in itself and beyond the scope of this book to conduct an extensive investigation into the practices of the companies in question, but a brief overview here can certainly be useful in giving some idea of which companies we should be putting our market power behind. Using the order of market capitalization at the time of this writing, from largest to smallest, the discussion will start with Apple.

On the issue of intellectual property and patent lawsuits, in recent years Apple has been just about as bad as any technology company in existence. They have filed lawsuits against Samsung, Motorola, and HTC seeking injunctions against the sale of various smart phones and tablets for patent infringement in multiple countries around the world.[88] In particular two of Apple's patents at the heart of the lawsuit merit particular contempt, the absurd patent on the slide to unlock feature of their phones[89] and the design patent that covers nearly any device that looks like a tablet.[90]

When it comes to the licenses they release their software under, many people will be pleasantly surprised to learn that the core technologies behind the OS X and iOS operating systems and the Safari browser are both open source. In 1997 Apple bought a company called NeXT Computer who had developed and operating system called NeXTSTEP that borrowed sections of code from the BSD licensed FreeBSD and NetBSD operating systems. As a result Apple chooses to release some of the source code back to the BSD community through the Darwin project which is licensed under the FSF and OSI approved, copyleft, Apple Public Source License. The rendering engine of the Safari browser is WebKit, an open source LGPL licensed project that derives from KHTML rendering engine that powers the Linux browser Konquerer. Both of these projects will be discussed in more detail in the operating system and browsers chapters of this book that follow.

Of course, the bulk of Apple’s software is released under proprietary licenses and in some cases, like iTunes, with enormous EULA’s to go along with those terms. The best way to summarize Apple’s relationship with open source software is that they use it when they think it provides an advantage to them, but won’t hesitate to take open source code closed or only release heavily restricted proprietary software if they believe it provides an advantage to them.

Microsoft even uses the threat of patent lawsuits to coerce royalties out of companies for their Linux servers.[91]
