20. Internet Browsers

In the browser wars, there are basically 5 browsers that dominate the desktop market, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, Google’s Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox, Apple’s Safari, and Opera. Consistent with my previous assumptions about the computer abilities and the demands of average users, I’m not going to discuss the only fully copyfree browser, w3m, because it simply is not practical for the average computer user. There are some other browsers that have significant amounts of copyfree code in them, but most users want features, such as extensions, that are only available in the big name browsers or won’t be persuaded to install a browser of which they have never heard.

One of the aspects that makes the choice of a browser from a libertarian copyright perspective so interesting is that the amount of copyright control exerted by the authors of different browsers varies even more greatly than between desktop operating systems. I
Grouped into several categories and presented more or less in order from least libertarian to most, here is my analysis of the copyright status of the major browsers.

Microsoft Internet Explorer – Internet Explorer is a fully proprietary browser. Licenses don’t get much less libertarian than this as it takes full advantage of every bit of copyright protection afforded to it by the law. Unfortunately, the story doesn’t end there. Microsoft refuses to have IE natively support open formats that don’t require licensing patents like WebM and the Ogg formats in an attempt to ensure that proprietary formats like H.264 become the standard on the web.

Opera – Created by the Norwegian company Opera Software ASA, the Opera browser is the 5th most popular browser worldwide but is the most popular browser in some Eastern European countries. Like IE it is a fully proprietary browser taking full advantage of copyright protection.

It should noted that while Opera fully endorses copyright, they are opposed to software patents. Considering that they are going head to head with Microsoft, Apple and Google in the browser market, their patent position is likely driven more by trying to avoid being the subject of a patent lawsuit than anything else. It is also important to note that Opera natively supports the open HTML5 formats Ogg Vorbis and Theora along with WebM, while choosing not to support the proprietary AAC or MP3 audio formats or the proprietary MPEG-4 or H.264 video formats.

Apple Safari – Though Apple based their browser on the LGPL licensed WebKit rendering engine that they forked from KHTML, they have kept every bit of code that they were not forced to open source under the provisions of the LGPL license as proprietary code. This example is an interesting case study because it illustrates what can happen in in the world of interaction between free and proprietary software.

For those who believe that copyleft licenses are no better than copyright ones, Safari is no better than IE or Opera in terms of its license. If you believe as I do, that copyleft is at least a marginal improvement over fully proprietary software, then Safari represents some improvement, but not much. However, Safari represents a clear step in the wrong direction when it comes to HTML5 format support. In the exact opposite manner of Opera, Safari only supports the proprietary formats and provides no support for any of the open formats.

Google Chrome – Chrome is Google’s proprietary browser built on top the Chromium project. It adds in several proprietary features such as an automatic updating feature, a built in PDF reader and an option to send error data to Google.

If your goal is to use the software under the least restrictive license possible, then Chromium represents a substantial improvement over Chrome. However, from the perspective of a libertarian activist who has a goal of picking software with the intent to promote the development and use of software that isn’t restricted by copyright, I am not so sure that it matters because Google is writing and releasing all of the important code under a copyfree BSD license.

Chrome is also the only browser to straddle the HTML5 format wars between proprietary and open formats in choosing to support all of the previously mentioned formats except for the MPEG-4 video format which is only supported by Safari.

Mozilla Firefox – Most of the code in Firefox is tri-licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), the GNU GPL and the GNU LGPL. The Free Software Foundation criticizes the MPL for being too weak in its copyleft restrictions, but from a libertarian perspective, this is a good thing.
Plenty has already been written on copyleft from a libertarian perspective and all of it applies to the licenses of Firefox. See for example Chad Perrin here and Stephan Kinsella here and here.

Firefox takes the same HTML5 format support strategy as Opera and chooses to only support the open formats and none of the proprietary ones.
[Edit 4/16/2012] It appears that Mozilla has caved on H.264 video support and will be introducing it to future versions of Firefox. See here and here. [/Edit]

Google Chromium – Notice that this is ChromIUM and not ChromE. Chromium is the FOSS project that provides the code that powers Google’s Chrome browser and is in itself a fully functioning browser. A little note on the side of the Chromium project homepage tells us nearly all we need to know:
Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license, and examples are licensed under the BSD License.

It doesn’t get much more libertarian than CC-BY and the BSD License. What prevents this browser from receiving the full libertarian stamp of approval is that the BSD License only applies to new code contributed to the project by Google. Chromium uses code from WebKit that is licensed under the GNU LGPL which does not qualify as a libertarian license as well as some code that is licensed under other copyleft licenses.

In terms of the most libertarian browser, there is no debate that it is Chromium. Unless you are running a distribution of Linux that has a regularly updated Chromium build already in its software repositories (the existence of which is in my mind one of the huge advantages of running Linux), there is really no good way to install and even more importantly update Chromium. As a result for people running either Windows or OS X, Chromium fails the average user test who does not want to have to constantly manually look up and update their browser from the depths of the Google Chromium build repositories. The automatic updater and ease of installation make all the difference. For those reasons, it is not software I would install on my parents computer for them to use and therefore, for some users I think

Picking from the other 5 browsers that are options for the average user on a Windows or Apple computer, it is rather clear that Internet Explorer finishes dead last being entirely proprietary and supporting no open formats. Comparing Safari and Opera is basically the LGPL licensing of Safari’s WebKit against the support for open formats from Opera. Considering the importance of open formats for HTML5 media players and that choosing to use free software rather than write your own as part of a piece of proprietary software isn’t all that meritorious, Opera comes out ahead of Safari.
That leaves Chrome and Firefox as the candidates for the next most libertarian browser.

On one hand, Chrome is more restricted because the entire browser, minus the WebKit rendering engine and a few other bits of software, is fully proprietary code. However, on the other, the creator of Chrome, Google, is releasing that same code under a fully libertarian BSD license through Chromium. While, it’s true that this special arrangement could theoretically end at any time, I don’t believe that the theory of how this kind of relationship should be thought of from a libertarian perspective is anywhere near fully developed enough to really know how to evaluate this relationship and the implications that someone’s browser choice has on it.

In contrast, every bit of the code in Firefox is copylefted. The Mozilla Foundation shares roughly the same vision for software copyright as the Free Software Foundation. They utilize less copyright protection for their software, but produce no copyfree code at all. Thus, rating Firefox on a libertarian scale depends largely on where copyleft software falls on the spectrum between code that isn’t copyrighted at all and fully proprietary software.

It is not entirely clear which one does more to oppose copyright from a libertarian perspective. There are many complex relationships between browsers and other technologies. For example currently there is a huge battle over HTML5 audio and video format support. Mozilla refuses to enable native support for playing mp3′s in Firefox through HTML5 and only supports the open, BSD licensed Ogg format. Due to the network effects that I discuss in a prior post, whether proprietary or non-IP restricted formats become the web standard has enormous implications for the relevant patent and copyright holders and for developers of non-proprietary software of all kinds, copyleft and copyfree.

In essence, I think the ultimate decision really comes down to whether or not it is better to support the Mozilla Foundation or Google. Your use of their browser not only contributes to their financial success, but also places your vote as a user in the democracy of internet, formats, standards and protocols in their hands. And that discussion is one for another post.
