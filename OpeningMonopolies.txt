Opening Monopolies
Potential cover quotes:
“It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try[ing] to bring those things into what you’re going. Picasso had a saying, ‘Good artists copy. Great artists steal.’ And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.”
-Steve Jobs, 1996, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW0DUg63lqU


“The great danger to the consumer is the monopoly -- whether private or governmental. His most effective protection is free competition at home and free trade throughout the world. The consumer is protected from being exploited by one seller by the existence of another seller from whom he can buy and who is eager to sell to him. Alternative sources of supply protect the consumer far more effectively than all the Ralph Naders of the world.”
-Milton Friedman, on the Phil Donohue Show in 1979


“If [libertarians] are not willing to be part of the market `invisible hand' that non-coercively punishes Microsoft for its misbehavior, we invite the argument that only coercion will do.”
-Eric S. Raymond


"Open source is an intellectual-property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.”
-Jim Allchin, former Microsoft executive, 2001


“These companies spend a lot of money on market analysis, and they understand that, in the end, there will be a monopoly again. The one-winner principle still applies. To them, the world will not change greatly whether open-source or proprietary software is running the world's computers. The end result will still be decreasing average costs, and the same barriers to entering the market will still apply.
What is different, however, is that in an open-source monopoly the barriers to participation and influence will disappear. This will be a different kind of monopoly--an "open monopoly"--from which no vendor can be excluded from participating, including the big companies now joining the open-source movement. They have much more to gain by breaking the existing monopoly and replacing it with the new open monopoly.”
-Petr Hrebejk and Tim Boudreau, 2001, http://news.cnet.com/2010-1071-281588.html

One such example of a feature that Microsoft started building into Internet Explorer in 1996 was a technology called ActiveX. It is only available on Windows and therefore the more websites that Microsoft could get install features that used ActiveX, the greater the disincentive for a user to switch operating systems. Convincing website owners to use the technology required delivering website visitors that could use the features. That’s where the market share of Internet Explorer becomes so important. When its market share was over 90% in the first several years after the turn of the century, that meant 90% of visitors to a website had native support for ActiveX and the inability of some users to use ActiveX features ceases to be a huge strike against using the technology. Especially when a significant percentage of the people not using Internet Explorer can be dismissed as Linux geeks. In order to keep people using ActiveX in their websites when the percentage of IE users started to fall, Microsoft was stuck with two dead end options, either convince other browsers to support ActiveX or convince website owners to implement features that a significant and growing number of their visitors couldn’t use. The Mozilla Foundation that was responsible for the Firefox browser wasn’t going to support ActiveX and for obvious reasons the second option was doomed to failure.[37][d] Therefore, it shouldn’t come as much surprise that you probably don’t remember that last website to ask you to allow an ActiveX control to function.[e]

6. Brief History of Proprietary Software
It was not until 1983 that programmers were granted the same monopoly privileges over their work as literary authors when a US Court of Appeals reversed the decision of a District Court in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. That court decision expanded upon and clarified the 1980 decision of Congress to include computer programs in the list of copyrightable works. Before these radical changes, the machine readable 1's and 0's that comprise the fundamental basis of all software were simply viewed as another cog in the machine that didn't deserve the same protections as an author's literary writing.
Then Microsoft and Apple were giant assholes to everyone. The end.

The Software Choices

Starting with , there are really only 3 operating systems that are viable options, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (well really GNU/Linux). With either Windows or OS X, using them merely consists of paying for the ability to use the software on one computer for your own personal use and not much more. They both leverage the full weight of copyright law to prevent you from doing basically anything beyond the bare minimum. It’s essentially the all rights reserved of the software world.
Developing a new operating system entails an incredible fixed cost. The development of a modern Linux distribution from scratch was estimated in 2008 to be an almost $11 billion project at the prevailing software development costs.[123]
In contrast, Linux is licensed under the GNU General Public License is designed around preserving the four essential freedoms for software user.
In order to enable any user to do these things clearly this license is much less restrictive than the licenses under which you are permitted to run Microsoft or Apple software. The GNU GPL is not however a libertarian license and from a libertarian perspective is more restrictive than the software equivalent of the CC-BY license recommended by Kinsella for written work in two important ways through the power of copyright law.
First, that under certain it requires the release of the source code for software if an executable version is released which is a requirement of all free software. Secondly, that it is a copyleft license, which means that it requires programs that modify the code to also license those programs under the GNU GPL and is therefore less libertarian. In order to qualify as free software according to the Free Software Foundation, copyleft licenses are not necessary, but are encouraged.
There are examples of non-copyleft free software licenses that are more libertarian than the GNU GPL, such as the BSD license, and there are operating systems that largely use such licenses, I believe the most popular is FreeBSD. However, the community of Linux users is much more widespread and as a result the online support and information is much better. Plus, Canonical has spent millions of dollars working on a Linux distribution, Ubuntu, targeted specifically at non-technical users and from all accounts the next release, 12.04 due out next month, includes a much better version of the new Unity interface aimed at those users.

21. Epilogue - Why Open Monopolies Will Win
In the 1990’s and into the early 2000’s 


Now. You are Google. You make your money by selling ads on the most successful search engine in the world. One of your strategic imperatives is therefore this: you cannot allow anyone to operate a technological or regulatory chokepoint between you and people doing searches, otherwise they’ll stunt your earnings growth and siphon off your revenues. That’s why you ran a politico-financial hack on the Federal auction of radio spectrum to ensure a certain minimum level of openness. And that’s why you are, very quietly, the single most determined and effective advocate of network neutrality.
Now, combine these two visions and you’ll understand why Google is doing Android. Their goal is to create the business conditions that will maximize their ad revenue not just two years out but ten years out. Those business conditions are, basically, an Internet that is as friction-free, cheap, and difficult to lock down as the underlying technology can make it.[137]

Also a good spot to mention that Linus Torvalds said if he knew about 386 BSD he never would have created Linux.
